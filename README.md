**Motivation**

As food lovers, we like to explore new foods and share food that we love with other people. 

Oftentimes, we are unable to decide on where to go for our meals, or we cannot remember where to get certain types of food. For the first problem, we can only google search "food near me" to let google list out all the foods available nearby and see if there’s anything that suits our tastes. For the latter problem, our current options are to search google on the limited information we have on that specific food as well as to ask our friends and families, hoping that they know what food we are looking for. We are also keen to share good food places with our loved ones, but to keep recommending the same food over and over again to different people… it takes a long time to do that.

It is not uncommon for us to get unsatisfactory recommendations from the list of nearby food places by google, due to our own food preferences. Moreover, it could almost be impossible to search for a specific kind of food when we do not have the necessary keywords to search it up. So, we decided to make a platform where it can recommend food based on our taste and preferences as well as be able to find the food that we have been looking for! Moreover, if the platform acts like a social media platform, it would allow us to share good food with others conveniently too.  


**Aim**

We hope to make a social media platform that allows people to conveniently share and get food recommendations based on their tastes and preferences.
